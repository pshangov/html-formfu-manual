=head1 INTRODUCTION

L<HTML::FormFu>'s validation process is very simple and straightforward, and at the same time very powerful. Basically all you need to understand is how the different stages in the validation process work, and we already explained that in Chapter I - L<HTML::FormFu::Manual::BasicConcepts>. A good overview is also available in L<HTML::FormFu/"FORM LOGIC AND VALIDATION">.

=item Constraints

Similarly, L<HTML::FormFu::Constraint> provides a listing of all constraints included in the core L<HTML::FormFu> distribution.
